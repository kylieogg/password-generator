# JavaScript Password Generator
This application utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. When the user clicks the button to generate a password, they are presented with a series of prompts. The prompts include:

* Password length (between 8-128 characters)
* Numeric Characters
* Special Characters
* Lowercase Characters
* Uppercase Characters

Once the user has answered each prompt and at least one character type is selected, then a password is genertated that matches the selected criteria. That password is then displayed in the box for the user to copy, paste, and use as they need.
